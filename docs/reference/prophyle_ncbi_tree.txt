                 directory)
  <output_file>  output file
  <taxid_map>    tab separated accession number to taxid map

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -l log_file    log file [stderr]
  -r red_factor  build reduced tree (one sequence every n)
  -u root        root of the tree (e.g. Bacteria); will exclude sequences
