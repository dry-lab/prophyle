usage: prophyle_assignment.py [-h] [-f {kraken,sam}] [-m {h1,c1}] [-A] [-L]

                              <tree.nhx> <k> <assignments.txt>

Implementation of assignment algorithm

positional arguments:
  <tree.nhx>         phylogenetic tree (Newick/NHX)
  <k>                k-mer length
  <assignments.txt>  assignments in generalized Kraken format

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -f {kraken,sam}    format of output [sam]
  -m {h1,c1}         measure: h1=hitnumber, c1=coverage [h1]
  -A                 annotate assignments
  -L                 use LCA when tie (multiple hits with the same score)
  -X                 replace k-mer matches by their LCA
  -D                 do not translate blocks from node to tax IDs
