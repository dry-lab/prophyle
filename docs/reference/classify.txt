$ prophyle classify -h

usage: prophyle.py classify [-h] [-k INT] [-K] [-m {h1,c1}] [-f {kraken,sam}]
                            [-l STR] [-A] [-L] [-P] [-C]
                            <index.dir> <reads1.fq> [<reads2.fq>]

positional arguments:
  <index.dir>      index directory
  <reads1.fq>      first file with reads in FASTA/FASTQ (- for standard input)
  <reads2.fq>      second file with reads in FASTA/FASTQ

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -k INT           k-mer length [detect automatically from the index]
  -K               use restarted search for matching rather than rolling
                   window (slower, but k-LCP is not needed)
  -m {h1,c1}       measure: h1=hit count, c1=coverage [h1]
  -f {kraken,sam}  output format [sam]
  -l STR           log file
  -A               annotate assignments (using tax. information from NHX)
  -L               use LCA when tie (multiple hits with the same score)
  -P               incorporate sequences and qualities into SAM records
  -C               use C++ impl. of the assignment algorithm (experimental)
