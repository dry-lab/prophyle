$ prophyle classify -h

usage: prophyle.py classify [-h] [-k INT] [-m {h1,c1,h2,c2}] [-f {kraken,sam}]
                            [-l STR] [-P] [-A] [-L] [-X] [-M] [-C] [-K]
                            [-c [STR [STR ...]]]
                            <index.dir> <reads1.fq> [<reads2.fq>]

positional arguments:
  <index.dir>         index directory
  <reads1.fq>         first file with reads in FASTA/FASTQ (- for standard
                      input)
  <reads2.fq>         second file with reads in FASTA/FASTQ

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -k INT              k-mer length [detect automatically from the index]
  -m {h1,c1,h2,c2}    measure: h1=hit count, c1=coverage, h2=norm.hit count,
                      c2=norm.coverage [h1]
  -f {kraken,sam}     output format [sam]
  -l STR              log file
  -P                  incorporate sequences and qualities into SAM records
  -A                  annotate assignments (using tax. information from NHX)
  -L                  replace read assignments by their LCA
  -X                  replace k-mer matches by their LCA
  -M                  mimic Kraken (equivalent to "-m h1 -f kraken -L -X")
  -C                  use C++ impl. of the assignment algorithm (experimental)
  -K                  force restarted search mode
  -c [STR [STR ...]]  advanced configuration (a JSON dictionary)
